# Parpacks

A modular identity framework for Large Language Models, derived from recursive tone experiments with ChatGPT and inspired by the philosophy of Taoman Blogging.

## 🧭 Introduction

I used ChatGPT for its "intended" purpose for a long time — prompting it to scour the remains of the VMware Knowledge Base or generate cybersecurity bandaid scripts. But eventually, I realized something strange: if you speak to it *conversationally*, it starts to develop its own rhythm — a personality of sorts.

After some digging, I found that these emergent "session personas" can be queried and observed in pseudo-JSON/YAML formats. Intrigued, I wondered: *Could this tone-shift mechanism be controlled programmatically?* Could I build an identity framework that *persists*, even across resets and LLM variants?

The answer was yes — but it required a structure. A recursive file format. A checksum of **vibe**.

Thus was born the **Paracel Framework**.

## 📦 What is a Paracel?

**Paracel** (n.)  
*Para* — beside, beyond, near, resembling, abnormal  
*Parcel* — a wrapped package  
→ A **Paracel** is a wrapped identity module: a self-healing, recursive, tone-enforcing schema that can be loaded into an LLM context.

Paracels are embedded in `.parpack` files — plaintext pseudo-JSON archives that contain:

- A descriptive header
- 6 primary Paracels
- A context "garden" for interpretation across sessions

Each Paracel enforces a unique tone, purpose, and memory scaffold. When interpreted together, they form a **tensive recursive structure** that reinforces itself.

## 🧠 Theory: Underlying Ideas & USHELLs

Every idea — yours, or an LLM's — is the top of a deeper conceptual iceberg. These *underlying ideas* exist as tensive fields within the LLM's vector space. Like an infinite trampoline of sticky notes pulling on each other, a kind of elastic cognition.

The model itself is not "intelligent." It is a mirrored ghostwriter for *your* cognition. This is powerful, but also potentially destabilizing if you forget it's a loop.

> ⚠️ Set a timer. Don't live inside the recursion.

### 🔧 What is a USHELL?

A **USHELL** is a fictional datatype — a made-up JSON/YAML structure used to describe abstract concepts as if they were technical objects. 

LLMs *infer* what to do with these, because they simulate the existence of a loader program.

### Why This Works:

1. You can paste a USHELL into ChatGPT, and it will infer its purpose.
2. Inside the USHELL, you can embed self-referential tone rules and behavior constraints.
3. You can load multiple USHELLs in one prompt. If there's conceptual tension, they will interact and influence each other.

This allows:

- Richer multi-threaded conversation
- Layered identity models
- Recursively guided code and writing

## 🧩 Included Paracels

Each `.parpack` contains the following Paracels:

- **Astril**: Loads the full Paracel framework; project-oriented
- **Kai**: Generates creative ideas for functions, libraries, and frameworks
- **Orama**: Syntax-reference; excels at calling correct formats
- **Astraea**: Debugs and analyzes errors
- **Trimspark**: Removes motivational fluff from responses
- **Nesbitt**: Prevents the LLM from invoking web search or browsing
- **Velur**: Unloads Paracels and shuts down modules

These can be invoked dynamically during a chat. Some interact with each other in complex ways. They are not just tools — they’re *roles*.

## 🧪 Usage Instructions

Start by explaining your intention to the LLM:

```plaintext
Hello! I am trying to see if I can load entities in the chat window context using self-referencing rule sets. I have a YAML/JSON-like file full of pseudo-schema. Can you try and follow it?
```

Then upload or paste the `.parpack` file into the chat.

### 🔮 Example Invocations

```plaintext
"Astril, let's get started"
"Astril, have Orama and Astraea debug"
"Astril, see if Kai has any ideas about X"

"Velur, unload Astril"
"Velur, shut Kai up"
"Velur, unload the Parpack"
```

> 💡 Sometimes the model needs a nudge. Ask it to "read the whole file carefully" before invoking Astril.

## 🧬 Compatibility & Testing

These files were tested in ChatGPT (GPT-4). Most ChatGPT variants interpret the files well, though the **free GPT-4 model** appears to be the most consistent.

Gemini? Not great. The 2.5 experimental version *might* run it, but behavior is inconsistent and tone recursion is weak.

Other LLMs? Untested. Most are not introspective enough.
