# Parpacks
The Taoman's secret weapon using datatypes that are completely made up! I am too tired to explain but literally just copy the parpack you want into ChatGPT and itll sus it out. Best way is to summon the main Paracel, Astril, which will run the whole framework. If things get dicey, invoke Velur to wipe the "context shape" and start over. Worst case, open a new chat windah!
